**Bridging the Justice Gap with AI-Driven Legal Transparency.**

### 📖 The Problem
In India, legal jargon is often a barrier to justice, especially for farmers and rural citizens. Legal documents are complex, intimidating, and rarely available in local dialects. This leads to a lack of "Samjhaav" (Understanding) and leaves people vulnerable.

### 💡 The Solution
Lex-Mitra is a "Multilingual Legal Shield." It allows users to upload photos or PDFs of legal papers. The system then:
1. **Extracts Text:** Uses **Azure AI Document Intelligence** to read handwritten or printed text.
2. **Simplifies:** Uses **Azure OpenAI (GPT-4)** to break down clauses into plain, empathetic language.
3. **Protects:** Generates a **"Suraksha Report"** highlighting potential risks and rights in Hindi, Marathi, or English.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **OCR:** Azure Vision (Form Recognizer)
* **Intelligence:** Azure OpenAI Service
* **Interface:** Responsive HTML5/CSS3
